          A Timeline of Triumph The journey of "A Song of Ice and Fire" through
          the annals of publishing history is a tale of steady ascent, marked by
          a series of peaks that align with key milestones. Starting in 1996,
          the series saw modest annual sales, a slow but steady build that laid
          the groundwork for its future success. However, the true turning point
          came in 2011 with the premiere of "Game of Thrones," the television
          adaptation that catapulted the series into the stratosphere of
          cultural phenomena. That year alone saw a leap to 5.3 million copies
          sold, a clear indication of the show's impact on book sales.
